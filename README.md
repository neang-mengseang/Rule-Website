RULE website prototype

This is a simple static prototype using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To view locally:

```bash
# Open index.html in your browser (double-click or use a local server)
# Example: serve with python3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Next steps:
- Replace placeholder text with real content from RULE (ask for permission first)
- Add images and logos into `assets/` and update markup
- Implement more pages (About, Admissions, Contact)
